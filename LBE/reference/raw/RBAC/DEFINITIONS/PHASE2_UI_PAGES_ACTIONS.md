## Next Steps (Phase 3)

In Phase 3, we will:
1. Define ~60 atomic capabilities organized by module
2. Create capability-to-page-action mappings
3. Create capability-to-endpoint mappings
4. Build comprehensive capability matrix

---

## Notes for Implementation

✅ All 36 pages organized in 8 logical groups  
✅ All 98+ page actions mapped to endpoints  
✅ All pages have clear role-based access control  
✅ All pages support secure pagination where applicable  
✅ All pages use ETag-based caching for performance  
✅ All pages follow consistent UI naming conventions

---

**PHASE 2 COMPLETE - READY FOR REVIEW**

❓ **Please review and confirm:**
1. Are all 8 UI page groups correctly organized?
2. Should any pages be added, removed, or reorganized?
3. Are the page actions correctly mapped to endpoints?
4. Are the role-based access levels correct?
5. Should we add any additional pages or actions?
6. Ready to proceed to Phase 3: Capabilities Definition?
