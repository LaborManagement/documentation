# Onboarding Scripts

This folder now holds only the bootstrap SQL in `setup/`. The narrative guides moved to the new docs structure:

- Start your journey with `../start/welcome.md`.
- Understand the platform with `../start/platform-tour.md`.
- Learn the concepts through `../foundations/`.
- Follow the recipes in `../guides/` while running these scripts.

When you are ready to seed a database, run the scripts in `setup/` in order—the README inside that folder is still the authoritative checklist.
